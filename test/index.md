Cats communicate through body language. Here's what different behaviors might
mean:

| Behavior       | Meaning                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Purring        | Contentment, but sometimes stress |
| Kneading       | Comfort, marking territory        |
| Slow blinking  | Trust and affection               |
| Tail twitching | Excitement or irritation          |
| Ears back      | Fear or aggression                |
