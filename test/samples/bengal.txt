BENGAL CAT BREED PROFILE

Origin: United States
Size: Medium to large
Weight: 8-15 pounds
Life Span: 12-16 years

APPEARANCE:
Bengals are instantly recognizable for their wild appearance and striking coat patterns. Their most distinctive feature is their short, dense coat with leopard-like spots or marbled patterns. The coat has a unique sheen that gives it an iridescent "glitter" effect in the light.

Traditional Bengal colors include brown/black spotted, brown/black marbled, snow spotted, and snow marbled. Their muscular bodies, relatively large size, and confident gait contribute to their wild appearance. Bengals have large, oval eyes that can be green, gold, or blue in snow Bengals.

TEMPERAMENT:
Bengals are extremely active, athletic cats with high energy levels. They love to climb, jump, and explore their surroundings. Many Bengals enjoy water and may play in sinks or join their owners in the shower. Their intelligent and curious nature means they need plenty of mental stimulation to prevent boredom.

While affectionate with their families, Bengals can be more independent than some other breeds. They often form strong bonds with one or two family members. Bengals are known for being vocal and will communicate their needs and desires with distinctive sounds ranging from standard meows to unique chirps and trills.

HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS:
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Progressive retinal atrophy
- Patellar luxation
- Pyruvate kinase deficiency

HISTORICAL NOTES:
The Bengal breed was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Jean Mill, who crossed domestic cats with the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). Her goal was to create a domestic cat with the wild appearance of a leopard but the temperament of a household pet.

Early-generation Bengals (F1-F3) still retain wild traits and are often not suitable as pets. By the F4 generation and beyond, Bengals are considered fully domesticated while maintaining their distinctive wild appearance.

Bengals are recognized by most major cat registries, though some countries have restrictions on ownership due to their hybrid ancestry.
