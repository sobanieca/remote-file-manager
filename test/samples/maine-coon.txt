MAINE COON CAT BREED PROFILE

Weight: 9-18 pounds (females), 13-25 pounds (males)
Life Span: 12-15 years

APPEARANCE:
Maine Coons are one of the largest domesticated cat breeds, with males sometimes weighing up to 25 pounds. They have a shaggy, water-resistant coat that is longer on the ruff, stomach, and britches, with a bushy tail. Their coat comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns.

Distinctive features include a rectangular body shape, tufted ears, large round paws (often with tufts of fur between the toes), and a long, flowing tail. Maine Coons have a gentle expression with large, expressive eyes.

TEMPERAMENT:
Despite their imposing size, Maine Coons are known as "gentle giants." They are friendly, sociable, and good-natured cats that get along well with children, dogs, and other pets. They are not typically lap cats but prefer to be near their people rather than on them.

Maine Coons are intelligent and playful well into adulthood. They often have a fascination with water and may play in their water dish or even join their owners in the shower. They are known for their distinctive vocalizations, which include chirps, trills, and small meows rather than loud yowls.

HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS:
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
- Hip dysplasia
- Spinal muscular atrophy
- Polycystic kidney disease

HISTORICAL NOTES:
The origin of the Maine Coon is surrounded by folklore. One popular myth suggests they are descendants of Marie Antoinette's Turkish Angora cats that were shipped to America during her escape attempt. More likely, they developed naturally in Maine from domestic cats brought by settlers, adapted to the harsh New England winters.

Maine Coons were popular show cats in the late 19th century, but their popularity declined with the introduction of Persian cats. The breed made a comeback in the later 20th century and is now one of the most popular cat breeds in the United States.
