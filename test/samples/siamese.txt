SIAMESE CAT BREED PROFILE

Origin: Thailand (formerly known as Siam)
Size: Medium
Weight: 8-15 pounds
Life Span: 12-20 years

APPEARANCE:
Siamese cats are one of the most recognizable breeds with their distinctive color point pattern, slender bodies, and striking blue almond-shaped eyes. They have a short, fine coat with darker coloration on their extremities (face, ears, paws, and tail) contrasting with a lighter body. Traditional color points include seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac.

TEMPERAMENT:
Siamese cats are highly intelligent, vocal, and social creatures. They are known for their "talkative" nature and will communicate with their owners through a variety of distinctive vocalizations. Siamese form strong bonds with their humans and often follow them around the house, wanting to be involved in all activities.

These cats are remarkably playful and remain kitten-like well into adulthood. They thrive on interaction and mental stimulation. If left alone for too long, Siamese cats can become bored and potentially destructive.

HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS:
- Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA)
- Respiratory issues
- Dental problems
- Amyloidosis (kidney disease)
- Cross-eyed condition (less common in modern Siamese)

HISTORICAL NOTES:
Siamese cats were treasured by royalty in ancient Siam (Thailand) and were believed to host the souls of royal family members after death. They were first introduced to the Western world in the late 19th century when they were given as gifts to important diplomats.

The modern Siamese has a more extreme body type compared to the traditional or "applehead" Siamese, which has a rounder head and sturdier body. This change in appearance is due to selective breeding over the last century.
